			<p> It represents the emperor, the prosperity and power of the nation. Similar to the Chinese dragon (which has also influenced and appeared in Japan and Korea as fierce but benevolent serpentine dragons alike), the Vietnamese dragon is the symbol of yang, representing the universe, life, existence, and growth.</p>

			<p> In Vietnamese culture, turtles are considered sacred creatures that symbolize longevity, wisdom, and good fortune. This belief is heavily rooted in the legend of the Hoan Kiem turtle, which dates back to the 15th century. <p>

			<p> In Vietnamese culture, this elegant mythical bird symbolises grace, nobility, virtue and pride. According to myth, the phoenix burnt its nest and days later rose again from the ashes, and it therefore symbolises rebirth, regeneration and survival. <p>
